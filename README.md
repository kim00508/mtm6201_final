Carousel:
I attempted to create the carousel using both JavaScript and Bootstrap. However, I struggled to properly control the JavaScript functionality. As a result, I decided to stick with Bootstrap for this feature. I also faced challenges in positioning the carousel correctly across tablet and desktop versions. By utilizing CSS, I was finally able to place it exactly where I wanted.

Navigation:
I used two dropdown navigation bars from Bootstrap. However, the "Home" button, which does not have a dropdown function, initially failed to respond when trying to change certain elements. Surprisingly, the issue was resolved when I implemented a reset.css file.

In this project, I specifically focused on learning how to use Bootstrap. However, it was challenging to properly handle certain functions, such as changing colors or positioning elements exactly where I wanted them. While building this website, I faced difficulties managing these features, but I am confident that I learned many valuable points through self-study and problem-solving.
